                <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out
                    in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as
                    tax, accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your
                    personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.</p>
                <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either
                    delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your

                    technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers,

                    improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to
                    protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is

                <h4>9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h4>
                <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track
                    ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about
                    your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology
                    standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not
                    currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
                    choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in
                    the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
